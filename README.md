The folder "k_nearest_neighbours" contains the files to generate the plots seen on the report. 
The folder "neural_networks" contains the files to generate the plots seen on the report.

The folder "NN+LDA+LR" contains the position estimator scripts and support functions. 

The folder "position_estimator" contains the different models tested. The name of the file needs to be changed in testFunction_for_students_MTb.m on line 31. 

The folder "simple_neural_network" contains the function to optimise the parameter of a neural network. 

"knn_linear_regression" folder (uses knn+PCA+linreg) uses the linearRegression() function to find the parameters (weights) in training, and reconstitutes the output in estimation with a vecorial multiplication

"knn_non_linear_regression" folder uses knn+PCA+some nonlinear equation. This non-linear equation formula function can be changed in the nonLinModelFun() function

Finally, the "population_encoding" folder contains a script which is used to evaluate population encoding.
